<details>
<summary><strong>1. Tight-Angle Geometry</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**Goal:** Prevent vertex pinching where branches bend sharply.
**Scope:** `TreeMeshBuilder.cs`

- Bend rings inserted at child base
- Parallel-transport fix prevents tip ring twist

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Post-Trim Depth Cap</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**Goal:** After trimming back hard, regrowth is limited to early-year depths —
a branch cut to depth 1 can't grow 6 levels in one season.
**Scope:** `TreeSkeleton.cs`, `TreeNode.cs`

- Add `trimCutDepth` and `regrowthSeasonCount` fields to `TreeNode`
- When a node is identified as a trim cut point, record its depth
- Each new growing season, the cut point's subtree gets a depth cap of:
  `trimCutDepth + (regrowthSeasonCount * REGROWTH_DEPTH_PER_SEASON)`
  where `REGROWTH_DEPTH_PER_SEASON` mirrors the year-1 allowance
- `regrowthSeasonCount` increments each spring on affected nodes
- After enough seasons the cap naturally reaches the global `depthCap` and the
  special treatment ends

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Wire Rework + Health System Foundation</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**Goal:** Realistic wiring with meaningful consequences; health system that
future mechanics (watering, nutrients, trimming trauma) can feed into.

#### 3a. Wire Rework

**New wiring flow:**
1. Player aims and confirms wire direction
2. `GameState.WireAnimate` fires — time frozen, camera still moves
3. Branch snaps to `wireTargetDirection` immediately in skeleton data
4. A ~0.6 s spring animation plays on the mesh with slight overshoot + settle
5. On animation end → auto-resume prior game state

**New data on `TreeNode`:**
```
wireOriginalDirection   Vector3   direction at time of wiring
wireTargetDirection     Vector3   player-aimed direction
wireSetProgress         float     0→1, fully set = ready to remove
wireDamageProgress      float     0→1, accumulates after fully set
wireAgeDays             float     total in-game days wire has been on
```

**Set/damage accumulation:**
- Both progress values accumulate only during `BranchGrow` state
- Rate uses the same `SeasonalGrowthRate` multiplier
- `setProgress` fills over ~2 growing seasons at speed 1
- `damageProgress` begins filling as soon as `setProgress >= 1.0`

**Early removal (setProgress < 1.0):**
```
newDirection = Slerp(wireOriginalDirection, wireTargetDirection, setProgress)
```

**Re-wiring a previously-set branch:**
- Allowed freely; no cooldown
- Re-bending set wood applies a health hit: `damage = Lerp(0.05, 0.25, setProgress)`

**Wire colour progression:**
| Condition | Colour |
|---|---|
| `setProgress` 0→1 | Silver |
| `setProgress >= 1.0` | Gold emissive pulse |
| Damage zone begins | Gold → Orange |
| `damageProgress >= 0.5` | Orange → Red |
| `damageProgress >= 1.0` | Deep red, embedded |

#### 3b. Health System (Foundation)

**`float health = 1f` on `TreeNode`, range 0→1.**

Health thresholds:
| health | Effect |
|---|---|
| `< 0.75` | Growth rate multiplied by `health` |
| `< 0.5` | Leaves drop early; branch tints grey |
| `< 0.25` | Branch goes dormant |
| `<= 0` | Branch dead |

`DamageType` enum lives in `NodeHealth.cs`.

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Root System</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**Goal:** Visible surface/subsurface roots (nebari), trimmable in RootPrune mode
and naturally scorable for flared-root development.
**Scope:** `TreeSkeleton`, `TreeNode`, `TreeMeshBuilder`, `TreeInteraction`, `CameraOrbit`

- `isRoot` flag on `TreeNode`; roots are children of `skeleton.root`
- Gravity-biased `ContinuationDirection` and `LateralDirection` for root nodes
- Separate depth cap: `maxRootDepth` for root nodes
- `renderRoots` flag on `TreeMeshBuilder`
- `PlantRoot(Vector3 localDir)` — player-triggered from soil plane click
- `GameState.RootPrune`: tree lifts, roots revealed
- `HandleRootWorkHover()` in `TreeInteraction`
- `CameraOrbit` pitch relaxed to `pitchMinRootPrune` in RootPrune mode

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>5. Bud System</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**Goal:** Spring growth emerges from pre-formed buds set the previous late summer.

**Phases:**

**Bud Set (August):**
- `node.hasBud = true`
- Bud GameObject spawned at `node.tipPosition`

**Dormant lateral buds:**
- `dormantBudCount` tracks latent axillary buds
- Increased activation chance if `backBudStimulated = true`

**Bud Break (March):**
- Bud GameObjects destroyed
- Growth begins from those nodes

**Back-budding from pruning:**
- Nearest 2–3 ancestor nodes get `backBudStimulated = true`
- Next spring: elevated lateral activation chance

**New data on `TreeNode`:**
```
hasBud               bool
backBudStimulated    bool
```

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>6. Wound System</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**Goal:** Trimming branches leaves wounds that are a real health risk without care.

**Wound lifecycle:**
1. Branch trimmed → wound created at parent node
2. Wound GameObject spawned, scaled by `woundRadius`
3. Each growing season: wound drains health
4. Player applies cut paste → `pasteApplied = true`, drain drops to ~5%
5. `woundAge` increments each season; heals when `woundAge >= woundRadius × seasonsToHealPerUnit`

**Health drain:**
```
drain = woundRadius × woundDrainRate × (pasteApplied ? 0.05f : 1.0f)
```

**New data on `TreeNode`:**
```
hasWound       bool
woundRadius    float
woundAge       float
pasteApplied   bool
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>7–16. Early Systems</strong> ✓ done</summary>

These items were completed in an earlier development phase. Full details in the Completed log at the bottom of this document.

- **7.** Bud/Leaf Integration — `birthYear` on `TreeNode`; leaves from buds on old wood
- **8.** Growth Stability — `maxBranchNodes` hard cap, `vigorFactor` lateral scaling
- **9.** Leaf Energy System — `treeEnergy` multiplier from canopy photosynthesis
- **10.** Refinement Level — `refinementLevel` on nodes; segment-length taper per level
- **11.** Dynamic Leaf Scale — root pressure + refinement drive `seasonLeafScale`
- **12.** Ishitsuki (Root-over-Rock) — `RockPlace` + `TreeOrient` states, training wires, drape logic
- **13.** Watering System — `soilMoisture`, `drainRatePerDay`, drought threshold + damage
- **14.** Save / Load System — full JSON save/load; `SaveData`, `SaveNode`, auto-save on season end
- **15.** Root Area Box Containment — `rootAreaTransform` replaces radial spread; six-face deflection
- **16.** Pot-Bound Root System — `boundaryPressure`, `boundaryGrowthScale`, fill-in laterals

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>17. Root Visibility Bug (Post-Ishitsuki)</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**What was built:**
- `debugRootVisibility` toggle on `TreeMeshBuilder` draws GL lines on every root node:
  Cyan = isTrainingWire, Yellow = isAirLayerRoot, Green = included, Red = excluded
- `[RootVis] BuildMesh` log fires only on state change, not every dirty rebuild
- **Ghost root fix:** `SpawnTrainingWires` was calling `child.children.Clear()` on old
  root chains — removing list references but leaving old nodes in `allNodes` with
  `isGrowing=true`. Fixed by calling `RemoveSubtree` on each old child before clearing.

**Files changed:** `TreeSkeleton.cs`, `TreeMeshBuilder.cs`

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>18. Auto-Water</strong> ✓ done</summary>

Waters automatically just before drought threshold is reached. On by default; Debug tab toggle. When auto-water fires, the Water button pulses between light and dark grey (0.15 s). In-game-day cooldown prevents rapid-fire at high timescale.

**Files changed:** `TreeSkeleton.cs`, `buttonClicker.cs`, `ButtonUI.uxml`

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>19. Ishitsuki White First Segment</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**Bug:** The first segment of each Ishitsuki root chain (`startNode`) stayed permanently
white — never transitioned to bark colour because the age accumulation loop skipped
non-training-wire roots.

**Fix:** `startNode` marked `isTrainingWire=true` in `PreGrowRootsToSoil` so age
accumulates and it transitions to bark colour like the rest of the chain.

**Scope:** `TreeSkeleton.cs`

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>20. Ishitsuki Roots Continue Underground</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**Bug:** After a training wire chain reached the soil plane, the terminal node was frozen.
Nothing transitioned it into the normal pot root system.

**Fix:** In `PreGrowRootsToSoil`, after the step loop breaks at soil, create one transition
node at the soil contact point (`isTrainingWire=false`) that enters the normal root system.
Underground roots blocked from growing if tip is above soil.

**Scope:** `TreeSkeleton.cs`

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>21. Ishitsuki Cable Growth Animation</strong> ✓ done</summary>

**Feature:** New training wire chains visibly grow down the rock face each spring rather
than appearing fully pre-grown instantly.

**Implementation:** `PreGrowRootsToSoil(animated:true)` each spring places one segment
per strand. Confirm uses `animated:false` (instant full drape). Air-grown chain cleanup
preserves training-wire progress.

**Scope:** `TreeSkeleton.cs`

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>22. Fertilizer System</strong> ✓ done</summary>

`nutrientReserve` (0→2) on `TreeSkeleton`. Drains 0.4/season; `Fertilize()` adds 0.5,
capped at 2, blocked in winter. Growth speed multiplier: `Lerp(0.6, 1.4, reserve/2)`.
FertilizerBurn applied to root nodes each spring when `reserve > 1.5`. Fertilize button
+ nutrient bar on right-side panel. Auto-fertilize toggle in Debug tab. Serialized.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>23. Weed System</strong> ✓ done</summary>

RMB click-hold-drag-up to pull weeds; positive Y delta accumulates pull progress.
Rip chance (per type) leaves a stub — shorter, brown, harder to pull next time.
`Physics.RaycastAll` required to click through Bonsai/PlanterTable colliders.
Weeds parented to tree GO so camera-orbit drag doesn't conflict. WeedManager singleton
auto-adds WeedPuller. Herbicide button clears all + sets aeration penalty. Four types:
Grass (40%), Clover (35%), Dandelion (15%), Thistle (10%). Serialized.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>24. Fungus System</strong> ✓ done</summary>

`fungalLoad` (0–1) + `isMycorrhizal` + `healthySeasonsCount` on `TreeNode`. Each spring:
nodes with open wounds, overwatered roots (`soilMoisture > 0.9`), or low health (<0.5)
accumulate fungalLoad; infected nodes spread to parent/children with 25% chance; nodes
above 0.4 load take `FungalInfection` damage scaled by excess. Recovery: 0.1/season when
no longer at-risk.

Mycorrhizal: root nodes healthy 3+ seasons become `isMycorrhizal`; reduces nutrient drain
by up to 20% based on coverage fraction. Fungicide and herbicide both kill mycorrhizae.

Visual: leaf tint toward sickly yellow-green via `MaterialPropertyBlock` + `fungalSeverity`
field on `Leaf.cs`.

Fungicide button on right-side panel; dims when no infection present; calls `ApplyFungicide()`
(reduces all loads by 0.6) + immediate leaf refresh. All fields serialized.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>25. Species — Skeleton</strong> ✓ done</summary>

`TreeSpecies` ScriptableObject created with all core species-differentiating parameters.
`ApplySpecies()` on `TreeSkeleton` copies ScriptableObject values into existing fields on
Awake — zero changes to downstream code, existing SerializeField values become fallbacks.
`BudType` enum moved to its own file so `TreeSpecies` can reference it.
Species name displayed in Settings menu header.

**Starter species shipped:**
- **Japanese Maple** — Opposite buds, fast growth (0.26), thirsty (drain 0.14/day), fragile wounds (0.08 drain/season), wire sets fast (140 days), high lateral density
- **Juniper** — Alternate buds, slow growth (0.14), drought-tolerant (drain 0.06/day), resilient wounds (0.03), wire sets slow (280 days), strong apical dominance

**Species Visuals** (bark shaders, leaf shapes, seasonal colour sets) deferred to after Health Consequences phase.

<summary><strong>26. Multi-Tree / Quick-Start</strong> (moves here after Health phase)</summary>

Multiple trees in one session; save/load per-tree. Auto-generate a tree at a given age
with randomised style.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>31. Air Layer Root Continued Growth ✓</strong></summary>

Full spec in Backlog → Air Layer Root Continued Growth.

**Done:** `ContinuationDirection` now handles rock-surface deflection and soil-plane snap for
`isAirLayerRoot` nodes instead of early-returning. Continuation nodes transition to
`isAirLayerRoot = false` once their parent tip is at or below `plantingSurfacePoint.y`,
allowing underground growth to proceed as normal root segments.

<details>
<summary><strong>Species — Visuals</strong> (after Advanced Technique)</summary>

Bark shader progression, unique leaf shapes, seasonal colour sets (red spring flush for
maple, blue-green juniper foliage). Folds into item 25 ScriptableObject — just adds
more fields and assets.

<details>
<summary><strong>Pot-Bound Soil Block</strong></summary>

When pot-bound roots go unchecked for **2+ years**, they fuse with the soil into
a dense impacted mass that must be dealt with before Ishitsuki is available.

**Hard blocker** — `GameState.RockPlace` is gated until cleared.

**Two removal methods:**
- *Wash out* — hold-input timed action; slower, low trauma
- *Cut out* — use root-prune scissors on `isSoilBlock` nodes; faster, health cost

**Implementation notes:**
- Track `potBoundYears` counter on `TreeSkeleton`; increment each spring when
  `boundaryPressure` across all roots exceeds a threshold
- `soilBlockActive` bool gates `GameState.RockPlace` in `buttonClicker`
- Cut-out: clicking root nodes marked `isSoilBlock` in RootPrune mode shears them

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Branch Weight & Strength</strong></summary>

Heavy branches sag over time under their own load. Thin young wood bends; thick old
wood resists. Wires, careful pruning, and prop supports counteract droop.

> **Open design question:** Universal vs. species-gated? Large-branched juniper / cascading
> pine needs this badly. Fine-twigged maple probably doesn't. Likely a species flag
> (`branchWeightEnabled`) rather than a global system.

#### Core Data

Two new floats on `TreeNode`:
```
branchLoad     float   accumulated downward force (own mass + children's load)
branchStrength float   derived from radius and age; not stored
```

`branchLoad` computed bottom-up each spring:
```
node.branchLoad = node.radius² × node.length × woodDensity
                + sum(child.branchLoad for all children)
```

`branchStrength`:
```
strength = radius³ × woodHardnessFactor × Clamp01(node.age / matureAgeSeasons)
```

#### Sag Mechanic

Each spring, if `branchLoad / branchStrength > sagThreshold`:
```
sagAngle = Clamp((load/strength - sagThreshold) * sagSensitivity, 0, maxSagAngleDeg)
node.growDirection = Slerp(node.growDirection, -Vector3.up, sagAngle / maxSagAngleDeg * sagBlend)
```

#### Junction Stress

When a child branch is very heavy relative to its attachment node:
- `ApplyDamage(parent, DamageType.JunctionStress, stressDamage)` each spring
- New `DamageType.JunctionStress` in `NodeHealth.cs`

#### Prop Supports (optional)

Player places a stick prop under a drooping branch → `hasPropSupport = true`;
sag calculation skips those nodes.

**Scope:** `TreeNode.cs`, `TreeSkeleton.cs`, `NodeHealth.cs`, species ScriptableObject
**Dependencies:** Species system (item 25)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Air Layer Root Continued Growth</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Air layer roots (above-ground roots on the trunk) should keep growing after
confirmation — currently they stop at the rock surface.

**Behaviour wanted:**
- Air layer root tips continue extending each spring like any other root terminal
- Growth direction: gravity-biased downward
- If a rock or convex collider is nearby, roots deflect toward and along its surface
  (same rock-following logic as Ishitsuki, but running live each season)
- Once a root tip reaches the soil plane, it transitions to normal subsurface root behaviour

**Scope:** `TreeSkeleton.cs` (`StartNewGrowingSeason` root growth pass — relax the
`isAirLayerRoot` exclusion that currently halts their growth), `ContinuationDirection`
(add rock-proximity deflection for air layer nodes)

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Soil / Substrate System</strong> → scheduled as item 27</summary>

**Goal:** Different soil mixes with distinct properties that interact differently with
each tree species.

#### Substrate Components

| Component | Moisture Retention | Drainage | Nutrients | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Akadama | High | Medium | Medium | Breaks down over time |
| Pumice | Low | Very High | Low | Structural; doesn't compact |
| Lava rock | Low | High | Low | Maximum aeration |
| Organic compost | Very High | Low | High | Risk of waterlog + root rot |
| Sand | Very Low | High | None | Fast drainage |
| Kanuma | High | Medium | Acidic | For azaleas |

#### Derived Properties

```
waterRetention  = weighted average of component retention values
drainageRate    = weighted average of component drainage values
nutrientLevel   = weighted average × organic fraction
aerationScore   = inverse of water retention
```

#### Soil Degradation

- Each growing season: `degradation += component.degradeRate`
- At high degradation: `drainageRate` drops, `waterRetention` rises
- **Repotting resets degradation**

#### Repotting

1. Player enters `RootPrune` mode
2. New **Repot** button opens a substrate mixing UI (sliders, sum locked to 100%)
3. On confirm: new mix applied, degradation reset
4. `ApplyDamage(DamageType.RepotStress)` on all root terminals — recovers over one season
5. Repotting outside early spring → larger stress hit

#### Waterlogging & Root Rot

If `drainageRate` is too low and watering too frequent:
- `saturationLevel` accumulates
- Above threshold: `ApplyDamage(DamageType.RootRot, rotRate)` on root nodes per season
- No cure except repotting + removing rotted roots

**Scope:** New `PotSoil.cs`, `GameManager.cs` (seasonal drain + degradation), `TreeInteraction.cs`
(repot action), `buttonClicker.cs` + `ButtonUI.uxml` (Repot button, substrate mixing UI),
`LeafManager.cs` (nutrient-driven colour influence)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Tree Death</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Trees can die permanently if neglected or abused.

**Death conditions:**
- Average health across all trunk nodes < 0.05 for 2+ consecutive seasons
- Total living root mass drops below critical minimum
- Prolonged drought at moisture 0
- Multiple simultaneous stressors

**Death sequence:**
1. Warning signs over 1–2 seasons: leaves brown, growth stops, bark greys
2. Point of no return: UI warning ("This tree is dying — act now or lose it")
3. If uncorrected: all leaves drop, mesh goes grey/brown
4. Dead tree remains as memorial
5. Player can start new tree or load save

**Recovery window:** Between warning and death, aggressive intervention can save
the tree — success depends on how far gone it is.

**Scope:** `TreeSkeleton.cs`, `GameManager.cs`, UI (warning overlays, death screen),
`NodeHealth.cs`

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Branch Death & Dieback</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Individual branches can die and either fall off or remain as deadwood.
Deadwood management (jin, shari) is a real bonsai technique.

**Branch death causes:**
- Health reaches 0 on a node
- Shading: interior branches receiving no light for 2+ seasons die back
- Overextension: branch too long without ramification weakens at the base

**What happens when a branch dies:**
- **Light branches (small radius):** Fall off after 1–2 seasons. Parent gets a small wound.
- **Heavy branches (large radius):** Remain as deadwood. Can be trimmed away or preserved as jin.
  If left too long, may harbour disease (fungus system interaction).
- **Species variation:** Junipers/pines retain deadwood; deciduous species drop faster.

**Jin / Shari hook:**
- Deliberately kill a branch tip and strip bark → jin (deadwood point)
- Shari: strip bark along trunk → deadwood stripe
- Aesthetic/competition scoring only

**Scope:** `TreeNode.cs`, `TreeSkeleton.cs`, `TreeMeshBuilder.cs`, species ScriptableObject

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Gamification & Tutorial Progression</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Stagger tools and mechanics so the player learns one system at a time.

**Progression tiers (draft):**

| Tier | Unlocks | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Seedling | Watering, time controls, camera | Game start |
| 2 — First Cut | Trim tool, wound basics | Tree reaches depth 4 |
| 3 — Shaping | Wire tool, wire removal | First successful trim |
| 4 — Roots | Root prune mode, root planting | First wire set + removed cleanly |
| 5 — Refinement | Pinching, defoliation, leaf management | Tree survives 3 years |
| 6 — Soil Science | Repotting, soil mix, fertilizer | First repot prompt |
| 7 — Advanced | Air layering, Ishitsuki, multi-tree | Species mastery milestone |
| 8 — Master | All tools, competition mode | Complete a styled tree |

**Tutorial delivery:**
- Contextual prompts when a new situation arises
- Optional practice challenges
- No forced tutorials — tools unlock regardless
- In-game Journal/Encyclopedia

**Scoring / achievements:**
- Tree health score (rolling average)
- Style points (taper, ramification, proportion — algorithmic)
- Survival milestones (5, 10, 25 years)
- Technique badges

**Scope:** `ProgressionManager.cs`, `TutorialSystem.cs`, UI overlays, `GameManager.cs`,
save/load integration

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Decoration System</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Cosmetic elements placed on soil surface, pot rim, rock, or around tree base.

**Decoration types:**

| Type | Placement | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Moss | Soil surface, rock surface | Grows/spreads slowly; needs moisture |
| Grass tufts | Soil surface, rock crevices | Seasonal; green spring/summer, brown autumn |
| Accent rocks | Soil surface | Static |
| Figurines | Anywhere on soil/rock | Static (traditional accent pieces) |
| Fallen leaves | Soil surface | Seasonal scatter in autumn; auto-cleared in spring |
| Deadwood pieces | Soil surface | Decorative driftwood |

**Placement system:**
- Player enters decoration mode (new game state)
- Click to place on valid surfaces; drag to reposition; right-click to remove
- Snapping to surface normals

**Moss (living decoration):**
- Spreads slowly each season if moisture adequate; dies if soil dries out frequently
- Player can trim/remove
- Moss coverage contributes to moisture retention

**Scope:** `DecorationManager.cs`, `Decoration.cs`, `MossDecoration.cs`, `GameState.Decorate`,
prefabs, UI palette, save/load integration

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Air Layering & Branch-to-New-Tree</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Player can air layer a branch, then sever it and start a brand new tree.

**Air layering process:**
1. **Select branch point:** Click a healthy node with adequate radius
2. **Apply wrap:** Visual wrap appears; air layer timer begins
3. **Root development (1–2 seasons):** Small roots appear; grow stronger each season
4. **Separation:** When roots sufficient, UI prompt: "Air layer roots strong enough. Cut now?"
5. **Sever:** Current state auto-saved; branch becomes new independent tree in fresh pot;
   original tree continues with wound at cut site

**New tree from air layer:**
- Inherits branch structure, wire state, health, refinement of source branch
- Starts with air layer roots as its initial root system

**Scope:** `TreeSkeleton.cs` (air layer state, root development, separation logic),
`TreeNode.cs` (air layer fields), `TreeInteraction.cs`, `SaveManager.cs` (clone subtree),
`GameManager.cs` (new tree session), `AirLayerTool` game state, separation prompt UI

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Camera & Input</strong></summary>

- Full Unity Input System migration (currently legacy `Input.*`)
- Wire animation skip key revisited as part of this

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Multi-Tree Planting</strong></summary>

- Plant two trees in the same pot
- Root/branch collision and fusion mechanics
- Shared health/soil system

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Quick-Start / Auto-Generate</strong></summary>

- Auto-simulate ~1 year of growth in background
- Present 10 variation options; player picks one (or multiples) to start with
- Foundation: needs stable multi-year simulation first

</details>

## Reference

<details>
<summary><strong>Ishitsuki Root Selection — How It Works</strong></summary>

> This section explains what happens to existing roots when Ishitsuki is confirmed,
> for reference when designing future Ishitsuki features.

**What the code does at confirm time (`SpawnTrainingWires`):**

1. Every direct child of `root` that is `isRoot=true` is a **trunk-root startNode** —
   the first segment of each root cable. These are the only root nodes that survive confirm.

2. Every node below those startNodes is **deleted** via `RemoveSubtree`.

3. `PreGrowRootsToSoil` then drapes a fresh `isTrainingWire=true` chain from each
   startNode's tip, down the rock face, to the soil.

**Implication for the player:**

- The **number of Ishitsuki strands = the number of trunk-root startNodes at confirm time**.
  If the tree auto-planted 6 trunk roots before confirm, there will be 6 strands.
- The **direction** each cable drapes is determined by the startNode's `growDirection`.
- All the deeper, branching organic root growth before confirm is discarded.

**Future design note:**
If we want pre-confirm root work to matter more:
- Let startNode direction be influenced by where the organic root was growing
- Preserve the top N segments of each organic root chain as the cable's initial part

## Completed Items Log

All systems built across all phases:

- Procedural branch skeleton + mesh builder (`TreeSkeleton`, `TreeMeshBuilder`)
- Wire placement + bend (`TreeInteraction`, `WireRenderer`)
- Trim subtree + highlight mesh
- Leaf lifecycle: spring spawn, autumn colour gradient, stochastic fall, fall animation (`LeafManager`, `Leaf`)
- Seasonal time system + game state machine (`GameManager`)
- Camera orbit, zoom, Y-pan (`CameraOrbit`)
- Tight-angle geometry: bend rings + parallel-transport frame fix (`TreeMeshBuilder`)
- Post-trim depth cap: cut point tracking + per-season regrowth limit (`TreeSkeleton`, `TreeNode`)
- Wire rework: instant snap + spring animation, `WireAnimate` state (`TreeInteraction`, `GameManager`)
- Health system foundation: `health` on `TreeNode`, `DamageType` enum, `ApplyDamage`, health-gated growth (`TreeSkeleton`, `NodeHealth.cs`)
- Wire colour progression: silver → gold pulse → orange → red (`WireRenderer`)
- Root system: `isRoot` flag, gravity-biased growth, `PlantRoot`, `RootPrune` state, lift animation, soil-plane interaction, pitch relaxation
- Bud system: terminal buds set in August, bud GOs spawned/destroyed, back-budding on trim, `backBudActivationBoost`, old-wood bud chance
- Wound system: half-torus wound visualization, health drain per season, cut paste tool, `pasteApplied` tint, subdivision-cut detection, cleanup on subtree removal
- Growth stability: `maxBranchNodes` hard cap, `vigorFactor` scaling lateral/back-bud chances; fixed `InvalidOperationException` in back-budding loop
- Root Area box containment: `rootAreaTransform` reference; `RootDistRatio` checks XZ walls + Y floor/ceiling; `DeflectFromRootAreaWalls` handles all six faces
- Pot-bound root system: `boundaryPressure` counter, thickening over seasons, `boundaryGrowthScale`, `wallSegmentScale`, `potBoundInnerBoost`, fill-in lateral budget
- Ishitsuki (root-over-rock): `RockPlace` + `TreeOrient` states, rock grab/rotate/confirm, training wires, drape over rock via `PreGrowRootsToSoil`, `IshitsukiWire.cs`
- Trim trauma: `DamageType.TrimTrauma`, seasonal recovery scaled by `treeEnergy`
- Trim undo: 5-second real-time window; `TrimUndoState` captures full subtree; `Ctrl+Z` restores tree; countdown label in UI
- Health ring GL debug: `OnRenderObject()` draws green→yellow→red rings at each node
- Bud/leaf integration: `birthYear` on `TreeNode`; leaves only from buds on old wood
- Save / Load System: full JSON via `JsonUtility`; `SaveData`, `SaveNode`; auto-save on season end; manual save in Settings
- Root Area box containment + pot-bound pressure system
- Auto-water: fires before drought threshold; Debug tab toggle; Water button flash; in-game-day cooldown
- Ishitsuki white first segment fix: `startNode` marked `isTrainingWire=true`
- Ishitsuki roots continue underground: soil-entry node spawned at soil contact point
- Ishitsuki cable growth animation: `PreGrowRootsToSoil(animated:true)` places one segment per spring
- Ghost root fix: `RemoveSubtree` called on old chains before re-draping at confirm
- Camera jump fix: `OnGameStateChanged` clears `isDragging`/`isPanning`; `lastTargetPosition` delta compensation
- Fertilizer System: `nutrientReserve` drain/boost, winter block, growth multiplier, FertilizerBurn, auto-fertilize
- Weed System: RMB pull mechanic, rip chance, 4 weed types, WeedManager + WeedPuller, Herbicide button
- Fungus System: `fungalLoad`, seasonal spread + damage, mycorrhizal network, Fungicide button, leaf tint
